So if you want to access aws through cli then you can do so by:
1. Go to google and search aws cli install then install it.
2. To check version: aws --version
3. Open AWS account and go to security credential section of your account and then generate a ACCESS Key.
   This can be called as programmatic access.
4. In cli type aws configure, it will ask the access key and secret access key then copy paste it.
5. You are done!
