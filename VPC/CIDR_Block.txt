CIDR Block:

Classless Inter Domain Routing or CIDR is a prefix based standard for the representation of IP addresses and their routing properties. 
It was introduced to enable blocks of IP addresses to be grouped together for inclusion in router routing tables instead of needing to include massive blocks of individual IP information. 

It sometimes referred to as super-netting, is an alternate method of representing a subnet mask and is made up of the binary representation of the network address followed by a slash and 
a suffix that declares the total number of bits reserved that need to be matched in the address.

The old method of IP addressing came with inefficiencies that exhausted the availability of IPv4 addresses faster than it needed to. The classful routing system included classes A, B, and C:

Class A - Over 16 million host identifiers
Class B - 65,535 host identifiers
Class C - 254 host identifiers

The problem would commonly occur when an organization required more than 254 host machines and therefore would no longer fall into class C but rather class B. 
This means that the organization would use a class B license even though they had far less than 65,535 hosts. 
Therefore if an organization only required 2,500 hosts, they would be wasting about 63,000 hosts by holding a class B license which would greatly decrease the availability of IPv4 addresses unnecessarily.

CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM). This allows it to define prefixes of arbitrary lengths making it much more efficient than the old system. 
CIDR IP addresses are composed of two sets of numbers. The network address is written as a prefix, like you would see a normal IP address (e.g. 192.255.255.255). 
The second part is the suffix which indicates how many bits are in the entire address (e.g. /12). Putting it together, a CIDR IP address would look like the following:

192.255.255.255/12
This specifies that there are 12 bits used for the network portion that we are referring to and other bits are used by host.


For example, we could express the idea that the IP address 192.168.0.15 is associated with the netmask 255.255.255.0 by using the CIDR notation of 192.168.0.15/24. 
This means that the first 24 bits of the IP address given are considered significant for the network routing.

- To allow access from anyone anywhere, like say the internet, you can use 0.0.0.0/0 

- By the same token you could use /32 to limit access to a single IP address
  10.10.101.1/32 would restrict access to that single IP address.
  here, A "/32" subnet mask are used to represent the specific host address, with no room for additional hosts.
  it's a very specific address, often used when you want to refer to a single host rather than a range of hosts within a network.
